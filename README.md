# cs7641 Assignment 2
Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- mlrose_hiive
- PyPerch

You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install scikit-learn numpy yellowbrick seaborn matplotlib pandas jupyter tensorflow pyperch
```
## Getting Started

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jakeyvee/cs7641_a2.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd cs7641_a2
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```
jupyter notebook
```
Open the desired notebook in your browser.

## Project Structure
The project contains two Jupyter Notebooks:

- FFP_NQP_TUNING_FIT.ipynb
- NN_TUNING_FIT.ipynb

## Running the Code
1. Once you have opened the desired notebook in Jupyter, you can run the code cells individually or run the entire notebook at once.
2. To run a single code cell, click on the cell and press Shift + Enter or click the "Run" button in the toolbar.
3. To run the entire notebook, you can go to the "Cell" menu and select "Run All" or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + Enter.
4. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, visualizations, and analysis of the results obtained from applying different supervised learning algorithms to the respective datasets. The notebooks compare the performance of the algorithms and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
5. Feel free to explore the notebooks, modify the code, and experiment with different settings or algorithms to further enhance your understanding of supervised learning techniques.
